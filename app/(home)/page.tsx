          Ten years ago, in a classroom tucked away in the corner of our high
          school, we found ourselves deeply engrossed in a discussion. We talked
          about the disparities around the globe, the urgent problems of
          poverty, ignorance, and environmental destruction. Each of us felt a
          sense of responsibility, a desire to make a difference beyond our own
          lives. As we delved deeper into our conversation, an idea began to
          take shapeâ€”an idea that would later blossom into something far greater
          than we could have ever imagined. We dreamed of creating an
          organization that would address these issues head-on, an NGO that
          would bring hope and change to communities in need. Treaties were
          drawn, promises made. We eventually graduated high school and went
          down our own separate paths, but idea of Meeraki always brought us
          back together. With time, we grew sceptical, but we were unwilling to
          let go of our â€˜childish dreamâ€™.

          The previous ten years were marked by cynicism as we battled our own
          anxieties and concerns, questioning whether we actually had it in us
          to make a difference in the world. Slowly but surely, our vision began
          to take shape. We organized fundraisers, volunteered in our
          communities, and sought out like-minded individuals. We were small,
          but we were determined. And then, after a decade of perseverence, our
          dream finally became a reality. We formally estb. our non-governmental
          organization, introducing initiatives to combat poverty, advance
          education, and safeguard the environment. Although our path had been
          difficult and drawn out, it had also been immensely fulfilling. As we
          stand together now, we know that our journey has only just begun.
          There are still many challenges ahead, still many lives to impact. But
          armed with our passion, our resilience, and our unwavering belief in
          the power of collective action, we are ready to face whatever the
          future holds.
